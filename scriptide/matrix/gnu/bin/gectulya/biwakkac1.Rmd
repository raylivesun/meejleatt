Okay, let's analyze the provided text as the sample entry from the *Guide to the Scriptures*.

The text provided is:

```
Aaron, Brother of Moses

    See also Aaronic Priesthood; Moses

In the Old Testament, a son of Amram and Jochebed, of the tribe of Levi (Ex. 6:16–20); the elder brother of Moses (Ex. 7:7).
```

This text serves as an excellent example illustrating the typical components and function of an entry within the *Guide to the Scriptures*. Here is a breakdown of its parts:

1.  **Topic Heading:** `Aaron, Brother of Moses`
    *   **Explanation:** This is the main identifier for the entry. It clearly states the subject – the person Aaron.
    *   **Function:** It allows users to quickly locate the specific person, place, doctrine, or principle they are looking for. Often, as seen here, it includes a brief descriptor ("Brother of Moses") for immediate context and differentiation from other potential entries (e.g., other people named Aaron, though less prominent).

2.  **Cross-References ("See also"):** `See also Aaronic Priesthood; Moses`
    *   **Explanation:** This line, typically introduced by "See also," lists other related entries within the *Guide to the Scriptures*. Here, it points to "Aaronic Priesthood" (directly related to Aaron's role) and "Moses" (his significant brother and collaborator).
    *   **Function:** This feature encourages broader study by linking connected concepts, people, or events. It helps the user explore related information easily, enriching their understanding of the original topic.

3.  **Definition/Explanation:** `In the Old Testament, a son of Amram and Jochebed, of the tribe of Levi... the elder brother of Moses...`
    *   **Explanation:** This is the core descriptive text of the entry. It provides a concise definition and essential background information. For Aaron, it specifies his scriptural context (Old Testament), parentage (Amram and Jochebed), lineage (tribe of Levi), and key relationship (elder brother of Moses).
    *   **Function:** It offers a quick summary and foundational understanding of the topic, answering basic questions like "Who was Aaron?" or "Where is he mentioned?".

4.  **Key Scriptural References:** `(Ex. 6:16–20)` and `(Ex. 7:7)`
    *   **Explanation:** These are specific citations pointing to passages within the standard works (in this case, the Book of Exodus in the Old Testament/Holy Bible). They are often integrated directly into the definition, providing evidence for the statements made, or listed separately.
    *   **Function:** These references are vital for fulfilling the Guide's purpose. They direct the user to the primary source material – the scriptures themselves – for deeper study, verification, and gaining personal insights. They are the starting points for exploring the topic directly in the relevant scriptural texts.

**Conclusion:**

This sample entry for "Aaron, Brother of Moses" effectively demonstrates the practical layout and usefulness of the *Guide to the Scriptures*. Each component – the clear Heading, helpful Cross-References, concise Definition, and direct Scriptural References – works together seamlessly. It perfectly aligns with the overall description of the Guide as a tool to help individuals and families define terms, understand concepts, locate key scriptures for study, answer questions, and prepare lessons, thereby facilitating a deeper knowledge and testimony of the gospel as found in the standard works.
