8.  **Identify Other Relationships (Optional but good practice):** Are there other ways to relate them?
    *   **Derivatives:** d/dx(sinh(x)) = cosh(x) and d/dx(cosh(x)) = sinh(x). This is *two* relationships, but shows a close connection.
    *   **Addition formulas:** Similar to trig functions, but the signs differ slightly.
    *   **Ratio:** tanh(x) = sinh(x) / cosh(x). This relates them via a third function.

9.  **Select the Best Answer:** The request was for *one* relationship. The identity `cosh²(x) - sinh²(x) = 1` is the most fundamental and commonly used single equation relating the two directly, analogous to the primary trigonometric identity.

10. **Format the Output:**
    *   State the relationship clearly: `cosh²(x) - sinh²(x) = 1`
    *   Mention its name: "Hyperbolic Pythagorean Identity" or "Fundamental Hyperbolic Identity".
    *   Briefly explain its significance (analogous to sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1).
    *   Optionally, provide the definitions of cosh(x) and sinh(x) for context.
