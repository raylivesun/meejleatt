Okay, the most fundamental and common relationship connecting `cosh(x)` and `sinh(x)` in a single equation is the **hyperbolic identity**:

**cosh²(x) - sinh²(x) = 1**

**Explanation:**

*   This is analogous to the Pythagorean trigonometric identity: `cos²(x) + sin²(x) = 1`. Notice the minus sign difference.
*   It stems directly from their definitions in terms of the exponential function:
    *   `cosh(x) = (e^x + e^(-x)) / 2`
    *   `sinh(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / 2`
*   If you square both definitions and subtract `sinh²(x)` from `cosh²(x)`, the terms simplify neatly to 1.
